## Problem 1

**Read and clean the data; retain line, station, name, station latitude
/ longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance type, and ADA
compliance. Convert the entry variable from character (YES vs NO) to a
logical variable (the ifelse or case_match function may be useful).**

``` r
NYC_Transit_df = 
  read_csv(file = "NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv", 
           na = c("NA", ",", ".")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line:entry, vending, ada) %>% 
  mutate(
    entry = 
      case_match(
        entry, 
        "NO" ~ FALSE, 
        "YES" ~ TRUE),
    entry = as.logical(entry))
```

**Write a short paragraph about this dataset – explain briefly what
variables the dataset contains, describe your data cleaning steps so
far, and give the dimension (rows x columns) of the resulting dataset.
Are these data tidy?**

After importing and intial cleaning of the data, the NYC_Transit_df
contains 1868 observations (each having its own row; 1868 rows) and 19
variables (19 columns). The data cleaning steps so far include:

1.  First defining the cells with NA, . and empty cells are used to
    indicate a missing value.

2.  Then using `janitor::clean_names()` to clean up the variable column
    names to a consistent lower snake case.

3.  Next, `select()` specified the columns that I wanted to keep,
    including the range from line to entry, and additional vending and
    ada columns

4.  Lastly, `mutate()` converted the inputs in the entry column from
    characters to logical variables. Specifically, using `case_match` to
    chnage every “YES” and “NO” input respectively became “TRUE” and
    “FALSE” instead.

The data is clean in respects to ensuring that every variable have their
own column, every observation has its own row and every box / input is
just some combination of the variable and observation. The data is
however not clean in respects to redundant columns. There are 11 columns
used for route 1 to 11 where as ‘Route number’ should be a distinct
column for each observation. There should also be an additional column
called ‘Route name’. (Specify the route number then which the name of
that route is in two columns).

After cleaning the data according to the instructions, there are also
rows of identical data inputs. We could consider evaluating the
duplicates in a new column to indicate how many times it was repeated.

**Answer the following questions using these data:**

- How many distinct stations are there? Note that stations are
  identified both by name and by line (e.g. 125th St 8th Avenue; 125st
  Broadway; 125st Lenox); the distinct function may be useful here.

``` r
distinct(NYC_Transit_df, line, station_name)
```

    ## # A tibble: 465 × 2
    ##    line     station_name            
    ##    <chr>    <chr>                   
    ##  1 4 Avenue 25th St                 
    ##  2 4 Avenue 36th St                 
    ##  3 4 Avenue 45th St                 
    ##  4 4 Avenue 53rd St                 
    ##  5 4 Avenue 59th St                 
    ##  6 4 Avenue 77th St                 
    ##  7 4 Avenue 86th St                 
    ##  8 4 Avenue 95th St                 
    ##  9 4 Avenue 9th St                  
    ## 10 4 Avenue Atlantic Av-Barclays Ctr
    ## # ℹ 455 more rows

465 distinct stations

- How many stations are ADA compliant?

``` r
sum(NYC_Transit_df %>% 
                 pull(ada))
```

    ## [1] 468

468 stations (including duplicates)

``` r
Distinct_ada_df = 
filter(NYC_Transit_df, ada == TRUE) %>% 
  distinct(line, station_name)
```

84 distinct ADA compliant stations

- What proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow
  entrance?

``` r
NYC_Transit_df %>%
  filter(vending == "NO") %>%
  summarise(proportion= sum(entry = TRUE) / n())
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 1
    ##   proportion
    ##        <dbl>
    ## 1    0.00546

0.00546 (5.46%) stations without vending allow entrance

**Reformat data so that route number and route name are distinct
variables.**

How many distinct stations serve the A train? Of the stations that serve
the A train, how many are ADA compliant?

## Problem 2

**Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet:**

- specify the sheet in the Excel file and to omit non-data entries (rows
  with notes / figures; columns containing notes) using arguments in
  read_excel

- use reasonable variable names

- omit rows that do not include dumpster-specific data

- round the number of sports balls to the nearest integer and converts
  the result to an integer variable (using as.integer)

``` r
Trash_Wheel_df = 
  read_xlsx("202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = 1, 
           na = c("NA", ",", "."))
```

    ## New names:
    ## • `` -> `...15`
    ## • `` -> `...16`
